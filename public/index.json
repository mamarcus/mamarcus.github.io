These bacterial spp. have c-type cytochromes present in their outer cell membranes and pili to faciliate direct electron transfer (DET) which sustains the process (Martinez et al.2013; Rabaey \u0026amp;Rozendal, 2010). Those bacterial species are generally immobilised on the surfaces of anode and cathode in an anaerobic environment. The electrodes are connected through a power source and separated by a selective membrane. The general mechanism inside the cell involves oxidation of electron donor substrate by the microbes resulting in electrons being released to anode, which is then mobilised towards cathode via the power source. At cathode, along with generated protons permeated across membrane, the electron flow is received by microbes to reduce the electron accepting substrates, which will result in fuels, chemicals and less toxic substances (Nevin et al., 2010). The flow of electric current between anode and cathode sustains the electrode catalysis of microbes mostly with little electrical input and zero chemicals, while the release of CO2 at anode could be collected and reused and reduced at cathode to produce valuable byproducts such as biopolymers, methane, and ethanol, etc., which in turn makes the system more attractive for waste management and bioremediation. The selective membranes prevents the flow of oxygen to cathode region, which ensures the accumulation of proton charge. Further, poising the cathodes at selective electric potential (Nernst law) prevents the build up of explosive gases inside the chamber that ensures better control over the system (Lovley, 2011).\nScope and system boundary  As in figure 1, the system boundary includes the inputs required for production of biogas and ethanol such as energy (electricity mix data, pretreatment and post-treatment, and manufacture of chemicals), fuel (transportation), chemicals, electrodes, reactors, and infrastructure of WWTP. Negligible emissions such as EOL of infrastructure can be avoided. Comparison studies (Foley et al.2010) premise their findings based on assumption that all the systems treat equal amount of input (waste water) with selective current density (1000 A.m3). When integration happens, the MEC system has to be modelled for reduction in inputs received and the change in respective current density (applied voltage) at which it operates.\nAllocation  Waste effluents from the system generate by-products such as biogas, ethanol, and CO2. Biogas remains an alternative to natural gas; ethanol has multiple uses with production from chemical and fermentation methods; and CO2 has wide applications in industry and it can also used as an input to same MES system or another MES system to produce other valuable by-products . Therefore, system could be expanded to credit the avoided production of natural gas , ethanol and CO2 by conventional production methods. If the resultant sludge from MES is used for fertiliser rather than being landfilled, then the system may be expanded further. However, it is expected that savings from expansion would be nullified by transportation and storage of fertiliser, given the quantity of fertiliser obtained. Therefore , it might be modelled for being landfilled or being left out based on cut-off approach if the impact is negligible.\nReferences Foley, J.M., Rozendal, R.A., Hertle, C.K., Lant, P.A., \u0026amp; Rabaey, K.(2010).

The functional unit is 1 MJ of the output fuel. It follows an aggregated approach in which the refinery plant is considered to be a single module which encompasses sub-modules. The sub-process emissions in refinery are aggregated and emissions are calculated for total energy use. The refinery configurations are broadly classified as heavy crude refineries, medium crude, and light crude. Based on the above configurations, LCI is intended for the following refinery outputs: LPG, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, kerosene, jet-fuel, diesel, heavy fuel oil, lubricating oil, wax, asphalts, and liquid fuel from coal.\nThe whole framework could be divided into two types of models for the ease of data collection: foreground model and background model. Foreground model is developed on primary data while the background model is based on secondary data. In this study, extraction, transportation, infrastructure, blending components (chemicals) and electricity will be part of the background model. Refinery and its sub-processes are covered under foreground model. However, for some components of foreground model such as import from foreign countries that involves global supply chain, resorting to background model is imminent due to complex supply chains involved.\nThe study targets eight categories of refined fuels: 1) butane and propane, 2) naphtha, 3) gasoline(petrol), 4) kerosene and jet fuel, 5) diesel and gas oil, 6) lubricants and other products, 7) fuel oils and 8) other residues.The technologies that are assumed for the refinery process flows are :\n Unifer for sulphur and nitrogen removal for gasoline.

Based in Singapore, this is one of the first studies in the literature that applies both attributional and consequential life cycle approaches to compare the global warming potential and embodied energies of these two materials, which are widely used for the structural parts of buildings. It was found that 1 kilogram (kg) of steel can be replaced by 1 or 4.25 kg of reinforced concrete. Two consequential scenarios for each of three combinations of primary and secondary steel were assessed. It was found that reinforced concrete produces less carbon dioxide emissions and incurs less embodied energy in most of these cases, but when different sustainable primary steel‚Äêmaking technologies were incorporated, these results may be reversed. We applied consequential life cycle assessment and scenario analysis to describe how changes in the demand for structural steel and reinforced concrete in Singapore's building industry give rise to different environmental impacts. Specifically, the consequential life cycle approach revealed that, over the short term, the impact of substituting steel with reinforced concrete depends on the difference in impacts resulting from the transportation of these two materials within Singapore. Based on these lessons, integrated technology policies to improve the overall sustainability of using steel for construction were proposed.","tags":["Consequential","Metals","LCA"],"title":"Steel-versus-Concrete Debate Revisited: Global Warming Potential and Embodied Energy Analyses based on Attributional and Consequential Life Cycle Perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MAGHIMAI Marcus","DAIGO Ichiro","KUA Harn Wei"],"categories":null,"content":"  Steel Markov Chain MFA   Abstract  Consumption of minerals and ores is imperative for economic growth.

In India, the contribution of renewable energy towards sustainable development can be found at three levels: At the regional level, renewable energy delivers clean energy to rural populations in promoting their livelihoods; at the national level, it diversifies country‚Äôs energy mix to strengthen energy security; and at the international level, it helps the country to keep its commitment on climate change mitigation. Despite the initiatives undertaken to promote renewable energy for the past three decades, the deployment level and the benefits accrued as a result to the rural population is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to address the barriers for renewable energy to understand the role renewable energy can play in promoting sustainable development in rural India This study analyzes the barriers for renewable energy use in rural India by examining the viability of a socio-technical approach that includes different aspects associated with the development, deployment and adoption of renewable energy. The barriers are analyzed under following categories: Policy, technology, finance, institutions, capacity building and awareness. Finally, relevant measures are suggested to overcome these barriers. The conclusions in this study show that India needs a comprehensive legislative and policy framework to provide a stable environment for renewable energy in rural development. Further, towards technology development, deployment and dissemination, a bottom-up approach is needed to involve the participation of more rural bodies and other key stakeholders such as government agencies, research organizations, financial institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Innovative finance mechanisms such as microfinance, community finance, international clean energy and climate change investments, and performance-based subsidies need to be expanded and delivered efficiently to overcome the cost barriers. There is also a need to centralize information through online portals and increase funding for capacity development initiatives to accelerate knowledge dissemination and skills transfer to various stakeholders engaged in renewable energy development in rural India.","tags":["renewable energy","energy policy","rural india","sustainability","barrier analysis"],"title":"Sustainable Development in Rural India - Analysing the Barriers for Renewable Energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://mamarcus.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
